2019年末，到2020年，中国和世界很多国家经历了新冠状病毒(Novel Corona Virus / nCovID-19) 的传播疫情对抗。从最开始病毒传播等情况不了解，花费了大量的人力物力，也承受的巨大的经济损失，但在全社会的努力下，新冠疫情已在的中国境内基本控制，2020年3月19日，中国首次报告无新增本土病例。

新冠状病毒COVID-19是一个影响到多个国家重大安全利益的公共健康危机。从科学认知上，有很多固有观念必须迅速适应疫情的发展情况而转变。 由于很多国家错过了阻断指数增长的时间窗口，COVID-19已经演变为超过一国能力可以应对的巨大问题，只能依赖于多国联合的力量去应对。

病毒特点以及防疫要点：
- 隐匿传播，潜伏期，任何大规模政策都需要数周后看到影响
- 病毒传播非常快，传染能力强
- 非常高比例的病人需要重症医学支持，侵蚀有限的医疗资源
- 流行早期的大规模检测和社交疏离的干预措施对于打断指数增长(链式反应)过程非常有效
- 为了保护你的重症医学资源不被指数增长爆破，必须非常重视切断指数增长
但现在新冠状病毒仍在世界范围内传播，在有些国家感染人数持续增长，造成医疗资源紧张。 本站汇总新冠病毒疫情爆发以来世界各国采取的应对措施和经验，特别是中国经验，希望能梳理这场重大公共卫生事件的信息，提供详实准确的参考。

From the end of 2019, to 2020, China and many countries in the world have experienced the spread of new coronavirus (novel corona virus / ncovid-19) epidemic confrontation. From the very beginning, we didn't know about the spread of the virus, spent a lot of human and material resources, and suffered huge economic losses. However, with the efforts of the whole society, the new crown epidemic has been basically controlled in China. On March 19, 2020, no new local cases were reported for the first time in China.
The new coronavirus covid-19 is a public health crisis that affects the major security interests of many countries. In terms of scientific cognition, there are many inherent concepts that must be changed quickly to adapt to the development of the epidemic situation. Because many countries have missed the time window to block the exponential growth, covid-19 has evolved into a huge problem that more than one country can cope with, and can only rely on the strength of multi-national joint efforts.
Virus characteristics and epidemic prevention points:
-Covert transmission, incubation period, any large-scale policy will take weeks to see the impact
-The virus spreads very fast and has a strong infectious ability
-A very high proportion of patients need severe medical support and erode limited medical resources
-Early mass detection and social alienation interventions are very effective in interrupting the exponential growth (chain reaction) process
-In order to protect your critical medical resources from exponential growth, we must attach great importance to cutting off exponential growth
But now the new coronavirus is still spreading all over the world. In some countries, the number of people infected continues to increase, resulting in the shortage of medical resources. This station summarizes the response measures and experience of countries around the world since the outbreak of new coronavirus, especially China's experience, hoping to sort out the information of this major public health event and provide detailed and accurate reference.
